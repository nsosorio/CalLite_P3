Delta demand from special projects

!******************************************************************************
! City of Antioch - Pre-1914 water rights
! When Antioch's water intake at Rodger's Point gets too salty, the city purchases water from CCWD instead.
! A California Supreme Court decision required the State to ensure that Antioch had fresh water at its intake.
! The State and federal governments reimburse Antioch about 2/3rds of the cost of purchasing the CCWD water.
! For modeling, it is assumed that the Pre-1914 water is diverted when Rock Slough is below the 150 mg/l Cl- standard.
