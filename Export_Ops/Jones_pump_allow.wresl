There is no regulation for Jones at this time. However, we just mimic Banks PP. 
Defines Standard allowable & Max allowable pumping at Jones.  Jones can increase pumping
up to 1/3 of San Joaquin River flow at Vernalis if flow at Vernalis is greater than 1000 cfs.
    If SJR flow @ Vernalis > 1000 cfs then,
    Jones_max_allow = Jones_standard_allow + 1/3*(SJR @ Vernalis)
    But only upto physical capacity.
