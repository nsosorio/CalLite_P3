This code calculates two separate New Melones Forecasts
**************************************/

/*
The New Melones forecasts are used to determine demands and minimum flows on the Stanislaus River.
The first forecast (NMforecast1) is the February end of month storage + March thru September
inflows.  This forecast is updated each March.  NMforecast1 is used to determine the minimum fish
and wildlife flows, the Stockton East demands, and the Central San Joaquin demands.  The second
forecast (NMforecast2) is the sum of October thru September inflows.  This forecast is updated
each October.  NMforecast2 is used to determine the Oakdale Irrigation District and the Southern
San Joaquin Irrigation District.
