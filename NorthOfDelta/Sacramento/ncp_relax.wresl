Sets Navigation Control Point minimum flow with relaxation.  Minimum flow is
met at Wilkins Slough.  NCP minimum flow is 5000, unless percent delivery
for Ag is 65% or less, in which case it can be 3250-4500 depending on percent 
delivery.  Minimum flow can change during Jan-May, and then May value is used 
during June-Dec.
