!Bounds of Mar-May 8RI values to trigger export cuts + storage releases to meet the longfin smelt outflow requirement.
!trig = 1 is lower bound of the 8RI
!trig = 2 is upper bound of the 8RI
!Use 99999. (extreme high 8RI) value for both triggers so that only export cuts are triggered and not the storage releases.
