An annual delivery target is determined by dividing the adjusted Export Index by the 
fraction of total Annual CVP Delivery in Mar-Aug.  This is necessary because the Export 
Index was computed for Mar-Aug only, but here we need an annual delivery target.

A delivery target is set in March and can be increased (but NOT decreased) in
April and May.  Delivery targets in June through the next February will be equal
to the value used in the previous month, which is always the value used in May.
