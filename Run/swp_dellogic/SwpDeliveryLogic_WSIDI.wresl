Include all SWP delivery logic files.
************************************/

!Move steps 2 and 3 to front because of wsi-di dependence on Article 56 carryover.
!Step 2: Define delivery parameters for each contractor:
INCLUDE '\demands\swp_arcsplit.wresl'

!Step 3: Keep a running account of actual deliveries made to each contractor
INCLUDE '\deliveries\sumswpdel.wresl'
INCLUDE '\deliveries\swp_delivery_summary.wresl'

!Step 1: Determine SWP allocation (use either WSI-DI or CAM):
  !Option 1a - WSI-DI Procedure:
INCLUDE '\wsi_di\wsi_swp.wresl'
INCLUDE '\wsi_di\di_swp.wresl'
INCLUDE '\wsi_di\export_index_swp.wresl'
INCLUDE '\wsi_di\exp_based_del_swp_s.wresl'
INCLUDE '\wsi_di\delcar_swp.wresl'
  
  !Option 1b - CAM Procedure (note - must also include CAM cycle in main file):
!INCLUDE '\allocation\swp_allocation.wresl'

!Step 2b: Define demands for each contractor
INCLUDE '\demands\swp_demands_s_WSIDI.wresl'

!Step 4: Distribute SWP allocation to each contractor
INCLUDE '\allocation\swp_contractor_perdel_A_WSIDI.wresl'
!INCLUDE '\allocation\co_extfcn.wresl'
INCLUDE '\allocation\carryover_allocation.wresl'
INCLUDE '\allocation\swp_contractor_perdel_B_WSIDI.wresl'
INCLUDE '\allocation\swp_feather_perdel.wresl'
INCLUDE '\deliveries\swp_bound_del.wresl'  

!Pumping capacity is not 100% reliable; must take unit outages into account:
!INCLUDE '\conveyance_limits.wresl'  moved include to main file because after activating line CVP this needs to be after CVP dellogic -TF
