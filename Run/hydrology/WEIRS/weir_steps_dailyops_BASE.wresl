Does some setup for running daily weir operations code for the Sacramento and 
Fremont weirs in cycle 2
*************************************/

!Definition of daily fraction to map daily pattern

! reads in monthly flows from previous cycle
! total flow entering SacFeather node prior to Fremont weir spills

! total flow entering SacAmerican node prior to Sacramento weir spills

!Daily upstream flow estimation from a previous cycle corrected monthly flow and using the daily fractions.
!Previous cycle monthly upstream flow is corrected with the difference of previous and current estimated Fremont weir spills

! Computes how much flow would be entering SacAmerican node if there weren't Fremont weir spills
