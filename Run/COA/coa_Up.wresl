/*  This file contains the logic for the Coordinated Operation Agreement (COA).
    This logic is based on the 1986 COA document and on DWRSIM documentation and logic.
    The concept of the COA is as follows:

    1) If total CVP and SWP exports are greater than what was withdrawn from storage then
       there was excess water in the system called unstored water for export (UWFE).
       This water must be shared using the negotiated formulas.  The current formula
       gives CVP 55% of this water.  The rest goes to SWP. INT_IBU_UWFE = 1

    2) If total CVP and SWP storage withdrawals are greater than the total exports then
       there were In-Basin-Uses (IBU) that required storage withdrawals.  The responsibility
       for these requirements is to be shared according to the negotiated formulas. The
       current formula requires CVP to provide 75% of these storage withdrawals.  The rest
       is provided by SWP.  INT_IBU_UWFE = 0

    3) Often after meeting it's COA obligation one of the projects (usually CVP) can't
       export all the water it's entitled to due to export capacity.  This logic allows
       the other project to take any unused portion.  It's important that a project
       be allowed to take all that it wants before giving up any of its share.

    4) There are very specific definitions for UWFE and IBU in the COA document.  These
       definitions have been followed as closely as possible. Some things to keep in mind:
       - Storage increases are considered part of the UWFE and are shared as per the formulas.
       - CVP only includes Whiskeytown storage withdrawals, not storage increases in its
         definition of change in storage.

    5) Weights have been placed on the CVP share of UWFE (CVP_UWFE) and each project's unused
       share to allow each project only to take what it's entitled to plus any unused share.
       You don't want CVP cutting its export to allow SWP to take more water.

    6) For SWPDS, SHADS and FOLDS: positive is storage withdrawal, negative is storage increase.

    7) Total exports are defined as total Banks pumping including wheeling plus Jones pumping
       plus Contra Costa Export.  Wheeling is considered as a CVP export and is defined with
       separate wresl logic. */

/*
The goal temp_exp_penalty was added so that releases from upstream storage 
in support of exports beyond that necessary for H&S are penalized.
The penalty is set such that upstream releases will be made solely for flood 
control, instream flow requirements, in-basin use.  The purpose is to determine
project operations when based solely on upstream control objectives and not on 
exports.  The export pumps will still divert incidental water that is available.
The goal temp_DO_penalty places a further penalty on Delta outflow that is above 
what is required.  This temporary penalty was necessary to maintain the balance of 
weights between exports and Delta surplus.  Furthermore, a temporary penalty had to 
be placed on excess flows in the Trinity River.  This is to maintain the balance of
weights between surplus Delta outflow and excess Trinity Flow upon which Trinity 
import decisions are made.
