! THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS THE SETUP INFORMATION FOR THE G-MODELS 

! Define external function which performs the Newton Raphson procedure to get the
! delta outflow (cfs) required to meet a particular EC standard given the G-model parameters
! and Go for this station.

!define GET_REQ_DO {EXTERNAL } ! GET_REQ_DO.OBJ must be present in the run/external
!                              ! directory.
!                              ! Syntax and arguments for use are as follows:
!                              ! GET_REQ_DO(Go,ECstd,So,Sb,alpha,beta,n)

! The time step for daily model in years
define g_delT {value 1/(30.437)}      ! 1 day(1 yr/30.437 days) 

! Set max delta outflow requirement for salinity constraints
define flowcap_salt {value 25000.}   ! flow cap (cfs) for salinity requirements
